## Migrating from v1

For the most part, migrating from v1 takes minimal effort as v2 still supports factory creation of proxy connections with callback support.

### Notable breaking changes

- In an options object, the proxy 'command' is now required and does not default to 'connect'.
- **In an options object, 'target' is now known as 'destination'.**
- Sockets are no longer paused after a SOCKS connection is made, so socket.resume() is no longer required. (Please be sure to attach data handlers immediately to the Socket to avoid losing data).
- In v2, only the 'connect' command is supported via the factory SocksClient.createConnection function. (BIND and ASSOCIATE must be used with a SocksClient instance via event handlers).
- In v2, the factory SocksClient.createConnection function callback is called with a single object rather than separate socket and info object.
- A SOCKS http/https agent
